#  MUSIC for GC dataset

## Overview

According to [the census by R&A](https://www.randa.org/~/media/Files/DownloadsAndPublications/Golf-around-the-world-2017.ashx),  there are more than 30,000 golf courses all over the world.  They are good targets for automatic object detection reaserach due to their peculiar shape, world-wide distibution and uniform spatial size.  **MUSIC** for GC (**G**olf  **C**ourse) is the training and validation dataset generated by  [AIRC/AIST](http://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/) to support  global survey of by using satellite imagery.

First, we have picked up all golf courses in Japan imaged by Landsat-8 between 200* and 200*. Their profile are represented as polygons and the longitude/latitude of each point is stored in KML files

Next, [Landsat-8](https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-8) multiband images of these target areas were cropped into a 16 × 16 grid covering a 480 × 480 meter area. These patch images are classified as “positives” if the golf course cover more than 20% of the total areas, while patches with no solar panels are classified as “negatives”. The rest with the intermediate coverage (0~20%) were neither “positives” and “negatives”.
